I have the habit of clicking the Like button on every YouTube video I watch. And since I don't want to do that anymore, I made an extension that does that for me. Yes, I want to leave the Like, without having to manually click on the Like button ðŸ˜€

To install this extension on your Google Chrome, you must download it, and then install it manually. If you don't know how to install an extension manually, just do a quick Google search and you'll find out soon enough.
